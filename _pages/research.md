## Growth and Etching Dynamics of Low-dimensional Materials

![Competitive growth and etching dynamics of graphene](/images/growth.png "Phase-field modeling")

Explore the competitive growth and etching dynamics of low-dimensional materials through both theoretical analysis and computational simulations. Experimental phenomenon during the synthesis process has been investigated, which promotes the optimization of both quality and efficiency of as-grown products.
